# JASP
A plugin for Minecraft that announces in chat whenever a player undergoes some type of status effect. This includes poison, fire, wither, and drowning.

Credit to DemonWav for the idea and honestly most of the code, I just made it work on 1.14.2 and seperated from the collasal plugin that is StatCraft.
